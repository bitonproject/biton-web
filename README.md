## Re-build the Internet, together!
> <https://bitonproject.org>


### The Internet potluck

Connect with your friends and other communities, no matter how far.


### A taste of Internet freedom

biton doesn't share food with snoopy neighbors, or hungry-for-data bullies. 


### - Is biton anonymous? - NOT YET!

If you need to hide your identity, biton is not ready for that just yet. Instead, take a look at
[Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) and [I2P](https://geti2p.net) for anonymous browsing, or at
[Freenet](https://freenetproject.org) for anonymous publishing.


### The juicy details

biton is a peer-to-peer network built around **swarms** --- groups of peers that store encrypted files and relay
requests through one another. biton swarms interconnect in a global network that provides some degree of plausible
deniability, meaning that adversaries cannot be sure about who made the original request. In this way, biton can be used
for bypassing information controls and for building community networks around local data and services.


### Come along and BYOb (*Bring Your Own biton)

Make the network stronger by [running a relay](https://github.com/bitonproject/biton),
[contributing](CONTRIBUTORS.md) to the project,
[building biton applications](https://github.com/bitonproject/js-libp2p-biton-transport), and volunteering to your local
community kitchen.
